    Tell me about the lost world! I urged him. "I'm going there in two days' time."
    "What? Are you mad?" He sounded incredulous.
    "Not yet, but I am getting that way," I told him, with a grin. "The 
    expedition was a last-minute addition to my schedule. They have been trying 
    to reach a group of natives called the Chirpsithra for years. The Chirps 
    have asked me to join the party as a liaison."
